Ice cream
Mix up your recipe (no more than 4 cups total). It’s best when the mix is chilled before pouring into the machine.
Take the pre-frozen bowl out of the freezer and put it on the machine. Cover it with the plastic guard. Turn it on.
Pour the mix into the bowl as it’s churning.
Check it after 20 minutes. Add any extra at this stage, just before the ice cream is firm enough.

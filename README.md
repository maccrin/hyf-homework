# Homework

## Get git ready to work on homework

Using the `hyf-homework` repo. In the terminal run `git status`

If there are changes that have not been committed, figure out what to do with those changes

- Should they be committed to another branch?
- Should they be committed to `main`?
- Should they be discarded?

When you have figured out what to do with the changes and fixed those. Write `git status` again. If it says `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. Then you are ready to create the branch for this weeks homework.

### Creating the branch

Using the `hyf-homework` repo write this command

`git checkout main` - You are now on the `main` branch

`git checkout -b nodejs-week1`

This will create and checkout the branch so you are ready make commits to it
